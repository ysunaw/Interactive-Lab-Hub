# Final Project - Connect Four

Using the tools and techniques you learned in this class, design, prototype and test an interactive device.

Project Github page set up - May 3

Functional check-off - May 10
 
Final Project Presentations (video watch party) - May 12

Final Project Documentation due - May 19

## Description
Your project is to design and build an interactive device to suit a specific application of your choosing. 

## Deliverables

1. Documentation of design process
2. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)

4. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)
