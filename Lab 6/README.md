## Introduction

The point of this lab is to introduce you to distributed interaction. We've included a some Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generation (NLG) but those are not really the emphasis. Feel free to dig into the examples and play around the code which you can integrate into your projects. However we want to emphasize the grading will focus on your ability to develop interesting uses for messaging across distributed devices. 

## MQTT

MQTT is a lightweight messaging portal invented in 1999 for low bandwidth networks. It was later adopted as a defacto standard for a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. 

### The Bits

* **Broker** - The central server node that receives all messages and sends them out to the interested clients. Our broker is hosted on the far lab server (Thanks David!) at `farlab.infosci.cornell.edu/8883`
* **Client** - A device that subscribes or publishes information on the network
* **Topic** - The location data gets published to. These are hierarchical with subtopics. If you were making a network of IoT smart bulbs this might look like `home/livingroom/sidelamp/light_status` and `home/livingroom/sidelamp/voltage`. Subscribing to `home/livingroom/sidelamp/#` would give you message updates to both the light_status and the voltage. Because we use this broker for a variety of projects you have access to read, write and create subtopics of `IDD`. This means `IDD/ilan/is/a/goof` is a valid topic you can send data messages to.
*  **Subscribe** - This is a way of telling the client to pay attention to messages the broker sends out on that topic. You can subscribe to a specific topic or subtopics. You can also unsubscribe
* **Publish** - This is a way of sending messages to a topic. You can publish to topics you don't subscribe to. Just remember on our broker you are limited to subtopics of `IDD`

Setting up a broker isn't much work but for the purposes of this class you should all use the broker we've set up for you. 

### Useful Tooling

Debugging and visualizing what's happening on your MQTT broker can be helpful. We like [MQTT Explorer](http://mqtt-explorer.com/). You can connect by putting in the settings from the image below.



![input settings](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%206/imgs/mqtt_explorer.png?raw=true)



Once connected you should be able to see all the messaged on the IDD topic. From the interface you can send and plot messages as well.



## Send and Receive 

[sender.py](./sender.py) and and [reader.py](./reader.py) show you the basics of using the mqtt in python.  Lets spend a few minutes running these and seeing how messages are transferred and show up. 

**Running Examples**

* Install the packages from `requirements.txt`, ideally in a python environment. We've been using the circuitpython environment we setup earlier this semester. To install them do `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* to run `sender.py` type `python sender.py` and fill in a topic name, then start sending messages. You should see them on MQTT Explorer
* to run `reader.py` type `python reader.py` and you should see any messages being published to `IDD/` subtopics.

## Streaming a Sensor

We've included an updated example from [lab 4](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Interactive-Lab-Hub/tree/Spring2021/Lab%204) that streams sensor inputs over MQTT. Feel free to poke around with it!

## Make it your own
My partner for this lab is Yanjun Zhou and we are making a Tic-tac-toe together. 

**1. Explain your design** 
We are making a tic-tac--toe game for two-player. The two players can play remotely with each other by touching the place they want to put their chess at on a chessboard. Players will take turns to place their chess by touching on a chessboard. 

**2. Diagram the architecture of the system.** Be clear to document where input, output and computation occur, and label all parts and connections. For example, where is the banana, who is the banana player, where does the sound get played, and who is listening to the banana music?

The architecture of the system consists of two players's components. Each player has their own Raspberry Pi, screen, and a tic-tac-toe board. When it's one's turn, a 'it's your turn' message will be displayed on the screen. The player can then input their move by touching the tic-tac-toe board. The move will then occur on both of the player's screens. When a player makes a three-in-a-row, there will be a message saying who won the game and the game is ended. 

**3. Build a working prototype of the system.** Do think about the user interface: if someone encountered these bananas, would they know how to interact with them? Should they know what to expect?

The player who plays the 'X' chess will start first in the game. Each player will be informed of by a message on the screen when it's their turn to move. The layout of the touch chessboard is also identical to the chessboard on their screens, so they players know where to touch when they need to move.  

**4. Document the working prototype in use.**
